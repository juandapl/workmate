"content_scripts": ["todo place here cases for executing different js scripts."]

en manifest hay varias cosas interesantes que se pueden hacer
"browser_action" adds a button to the taskbar 
inside browser_action you have to put default icon, default title, and default popup. Default popup is used to make a popup appear when the button is clicked
web_accessible_resources is a parameter that states the files that the page can access.

all paths from manifest are relative to it.

the popup works like a webpage - with html, css and js for each page.

in a css file, html, body {
  width: 100px;
} define the size of a window/renderspace
